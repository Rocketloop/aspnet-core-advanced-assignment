# Backend Assignment: Simple Middleware

The assignment involves the creation of a simple Middleware for ASP.NET Core. Please use the following libraries and versions:

* ASP.NET Core 2.2+

**Updated @ Apr'19**

## Simple ASP.NET Core Middlewarei (2-4h)

Create a middleware in a ASP.NET Core that implements the following functionality:

* Replace `rl` with `rocketloop` in all values of JSON requests
* The middleware should only trigger for a configurable list of endpoints
* Write tests using XUnit for requirements mentioned above 

## Architecture and Design (30m - 1h)

There are numerous project design patterns that can be used in ASP.NET Core applications. Two very common patterns are either organizing files with similar functions in common folders and namespaces (e.g. Data, Services, Filters, etc.) and organizing files with a similar scope in one folder and namesspace per feature (e.g. Register/Models, Register/Filter, Register/Controllers, etc.) (feature folders). 

Please discuss the arguments for and against both patterns in a few bullet points and explain which pattern you'd prefer for a simple CRUD web API and why.
